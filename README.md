# Prior Authorization Reference Implementation

The Da Vinci Prior Authorization Reference Implementation (RI) is a software project that conforms to the [Prior Authorization Implementation Guide (IG)](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/davinci-pas/index.html) and the [Prior Authorization IG Proposal](http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=Da_Vinci_Prior_Authorization_FHIR_IG_Proposal) developed by the [Da Vinci Project](http://www.hl7.org/about/davinci/index.cfm?ref=common) within the [HL7 Standards Organization](http://www.hl7.org/).

## Requirements

- Java JDK 11

## Getting Started

Build, test, and start the Prior Authorization microservice:

```
./gradlew installBootDist
./gradlew clean check
./gradlew bootRun
```

To run the microservice in debug mode (which enables debug log statements, an endpoint to view the database, and and endpoint to prefill the database with test data) use:

```
./gradlew bootRun --args='debug'
```

Access the microservice:

```
curl http://localhost:9000/fhir/metadata
curl http://localhost:9000/fhir/Bundle
curl http://localhost:9000/fhir/Claim
curl http://localhost:9000/fhir/ClaimResponse
```

Submit a prior authorization request:

```
curl -X POST
     -H "Content-Type: application/json"
     -d @src/test/resources/bundle-prior-auth.json
     http://localhost:9000/fhir/Claim/\$submit
```

## Configuration Notes

The server on the `dev` branch is always configured to run on Logicahealth. If you are running locally or on another cloud server there are a few extra configuration steps:

1. This server expects to be running on HTTPS. If you are not using SSL the authorization will fail. Either follow the steps under "SSL Certificates" below to add SSL to your local version, or modify `getServiceBaseUrl()` in `Endpoint.java` to use `http`.
1. The default tokenUri points to LogicaHealth. Update `tokenUri` in `Metadata.java` to be the correct host.
1. If using the MITRE DTR Reference Implementation there are is a PAS config under src/components/PriorAuth which must be updated.

## FHIR Services

The service endpoints in the table below are relative to `http://localhost:9000/fhir`. `patient` is the first `identifier.value` on the `Patient` referenced in the submitted `Claim`.

| Service                                                                       | Methods  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

> _Note About IDs_: The Prior Authorization service generates a preAuthRef `id` when a successful `Claim/$submit` operation is performed. If the submitted resources do not contain ids their ids will be updated to `id`. The `id` referenced by the `identifier` in the request parameters is the preAuthRef `id`. The `Bundle` that was submitted will subsequently be available at `/Bundle?identifier={id}&patient.identifier={patient}`, and the `Claim` from the submission will be available at `/Claim?identifier={id}&patient.identifier={patient}`, and the `ClaimResponse` will also be available at `/ClaimResponse?identifier={id}&patient.identifier={patient}`. _All three resources will share the same `id`._

> _Note About DELETE_: A DELETE by `id` to one resource (i.e. `Bundle`, `Claim`, `ClaimResponse`) is a _Cascading Delete_ and it will delete all associated and related resources.

If debug mode is enabled the following endpoints are available for use at `http://localhost:9000/fhir`:

## Authorization

### SSL Certificates

This Reference Implementation requires certificates for SSL traffic. By default this is disabled since the hosted version on Logica Health adds its own certificated. When running on localhost you must enable https traffic. Configuration details are in `src/main/resources/application.properties`. The enable the default SSL configurations, remove the comments from the following lines:

```
server.ssl.key-store=pas_keystore.p12
server.ssl.key-store-password=password
server.ssl.keyStoreType=PKCS12
server.ssl.keyAlias=pas
```

To create your own certificate run the following from the root directory of this project:

```
$ keytool -genkey -alias pas -keystore pas_keystore.p12 -keyalg RSA -storetype PKCS12
```

You will be prompted to create a password for the keystore and then enter details about the certificate. Be sure to update `server.ssl.key-store-password` above with the new password you just created.

### Server to Server OAuth

The recommended way of authorization is server to server OAuth. The implementation details are provided in the [Bulk Data Transfer IG](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/us-bulk-data/authorization/index.html).

#### Register a new client `/auth/register`

Registering a new client requires providing either the jwks or a public url to get the jwks. The URL is the preferrable way.

```
HTTP POST /auth/register
Content-Type application/json
{
  "jwks_url": "http://example.com/jwks"
}
```

The server will respond with a JSON object containing `client_id`. This will be required for the client to recieve a token

#### Token request `/auth/token`

A registered client must obtain an access token before making any requests to the server. This is used to validate where the request is coming from and is used in the AuditEvent for creating an audit trail of all requests.

Following the `client_credentials` OAuth 2.0 grant flow the process is:

```
HTTP POST
/auth/token?scope={launch scope}
&grant_type=client_credentials
&client_assertion_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-bearer
&client_assertion={signed JWT token}
```

Th client_assertion is a signed JWT token following [this structure](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/us-bulk-data/authorization/index.html#obtaining-an-access-token).

The response will be a JSON object containing the `access_token`. This token will only be valid for 5 minutes. In all requests to the server you must add the `Authorization: Bearer {access_token}` header to the HTTP request.

## Contents of `/Claim/$submit` Submission

The body of the `/Claim/$submit` operation are as follows:

```
 + Bundle
 |
 +-+ entry
   |
   +-- Claim
   |
   +-- QuestionnaireResponse
   |
   +-- DeviceRequest
   |
   +-- Other Resources (Patient, Practitioner, Coverage, Condition, Observation)
```

The first `entry` of the submitted `Bundle` should contain a `Claim`, followed by a `QuestionnaireResponse` which includes answers in response to questions presented by Da Vinci [Documentation Templates and Rules](https://github.com/HL7-DaVinci/dtr) (DTR), then the `DeviceRequest` (or other resource type) that actually requires the prior authorization, followed by all supporting FHIR resources including the `Patient`, `Practitioner`, `Coverage`, and relevant `Condition` and `Observation` resources used in DTR calculations or otherwise used as supporting information.

To cancel the Claim submit a `Claim` resource with the `id` of the Claim to cancel and set the `status` to `cancelled`. If the Claim exists and is not already cancelled the database will be update to reflect the cancellation.

## Response of the `/Claim/$submit` Operation

Assuming the structure and contents of the submitted `Bundle` are adequate, the service will responsed with a `ClaimResponse` as detailed below. Otherwise, the service will respond with an `OperationalOutcome` containing an error message.

```
 + ClaimResponse
 + ClaimResponse.id = {id}
 + ClaimResponse.status
 + ClaimResponse.type
 + ClaimResponse.use = "preauthorization"
 + ClaimResponse.patient = { reference: Patient }
 + ClaimResponse.created
 + ClaimResponse.insurer
 + ClaimResponse.request = { reference: Claim/{id} }
 + ClaimResponse.outcome
 + ClaimResponse.disposition
 + ClaimResponse.preAuthRef = {prior authorization number}
```

With a successful submission, the actual Prior Authorization Number is located in the `ClaimResponse.preAuthRef` field.

For example:

```json
{
  "resourceType": "ClaimResponse",
  "id": "536d41f2-0273-4807-a0e6-8d9909146667",
  "status": "active",
  "type": {
    "coding": [
      {
        "system": "http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/claim-type",
        "code": "professional",
        "display": "Professional"
      }
    ]
  },
  "use": "preauthorization",
  "patient": { "reference": "Patient/pat013" },
  "created": "2019-05-04T15:32:06+00:00",
  "insurer": {
    "display": "Unknown"
  },
  "request": { "reference": "Claim/536d41f2-0273-4807-a0e6-8d9909146667" },
  "outcome": "complete",
  "disposition": "Granted",
  "preAuthRef": "536d41f2-0273-4807-a0e6-8d9909146667"
}
```

A successful submission will return a `ClaimResponse` with the status code `201` with the `Location` header set to the location of the newly created `ClaimResponse`.

## Contents of `/Subscription` Submission

`POST`ing to the `/Subscription` endpoint is used to submit a new Rest-Hook or WebSocket based subscription for a pended or partial ClaimResponse. Once an update has been made a notification will be sent to the subscription. The subscriber can then poll using the original `identifier` to obtain the most updated ClaimResponse.

The body for a Rest-Hook subscription is as follows:

```json
{
  "resourceType": "Subscription",
  "status": "requested",
  "criteria": "identifier={id}&patient.identifier={patient}&status=active",
  "channel": {
    "type": "rest-hook",
    "endpoint": "http://localhost:9090/fhir/SubscriptionNotification?identifier={id}&patient.identifier={patient}&status=active"
  }
}
```

For more information on rest-hook subscriptions jump to Using Rest-Hook Subscriptions.

The body for a WebSocket subscription is as follows:

```json
{
  "resourceType": "Subscription",
  "status": "requested",
  "criteria": "identifier={id}&patient.identifier={patient}&status=active",
  "channel": {
    "type": "websocket"
  }
}
```

For more information on WebSocket subscriptions jump to Using WebSocket Subscriptions.

## Response to `/Subscription` Submission

Assuming the contents of the Subscription are valid and the server is able to process the request correctly it will respond with the same Subscription resource and the id set to the logical id of the Subscription. For example, the response to a WebSocket Subscription would be:

```json
{
  "resourceType": "Subscription",
  "id": "{new subscription id}",
  "status": "active",
  "criteria": "identifier={id}&patient.identifier={patient}&status=active",
  "channel": {

  }
}
```

When using WebSocket subscriptions the id provided in the response is the id used in all WebSocket messages.

## Using Rest-Hook Subscriptions

Rest-Hook subscriptions require the client to operate an external server which can operate REST endpoints. The client server for this RI is provided in the [Prior Auth Client Github](https://github.com/HL7-DaVinci/prior-auth-client). By default this client will start the server at `http://localhost:9090/fhir` and will receive notifications on the `/SubscriptionNotification?identifier={id}&patient.identifier={patient}&status=active` endpoint. More details can be found on the Prior Auth Client Github.

The flow for Rest-Hook subscriptions is as follows:

1.  Start the Prior Auth service
2.  Start the Prior Auth Client service
3.  Submit a Claim to `/Claim/$submit`
4.  Subscribe to a pended or partial ClaimResponse by submitting a Rest-Hook subscription to `/Subscription`
5.  When an update is ready the Prior Auth service will send a `POST` to the `channel.endpoint` provided in the Subscription
6.  The Prior Auth Client will receive the notification and poll for the updated ClaimResponse resource. If the ClaimResponse has outcome `complete` or `error` the client performs a `DELETE` on `/Subscription`

## Using WebSocket Subscriptions

WebSocket subscriptions do not require the client to operate an external REST server, however

To use WebSocket subscriptions the client must submit a Subscription as well as bind the Subscription to a WebSocket using the WebSocket client. The steps to do that are as follows:

1.  Start the Prior Auth service
2.  Submit a Claim to `/Claim/$submit`
3.  Subscribe to a pended or partial ClaimResponse by submitting a WebSocket subscription to `/Subscription`. The response to this submission will contain the logical id of the Subscription used in step 5
4.  The client should connect to the WebSocket `ws://{BASE}/fhir/connect` and subscribe to `/private/notification`. For localhost the `{BASE}` is `localhost:9000`. To connect to the RI on LogicaHealth use `wss://davinci-prior-auth.logicahealth.org/fhir/connect`.
5.  The client then binds the Subscription id by sending the message `bind: id` (using the logical id of the Subscription) to `/subscribe` over the WebSocket
6.  If the id is bound successfully the client receives the message `bound: id` over `{BASE}/fhir/private/notification`
7.  When an update is ready the Prior Auth service will send the message `ping: id` over `{BASE}/fhir/private/notification`
8.  The client can then poll for the updated ClaimResponse

The [Prior Auth Client Github](https://github.com/HL7-DaVinci/prior-auth-client) provides a WebSocket client in `src/main/resources/index.html`. This client handles steps 4 and 5 through the web interface. Details on how to use the client are provided in the Prior Auth Client README.

## Demonstration

This project can be demonstrated in combination with the Da Vinci [Coverage Requirements Discovery](https://github.com/HL7-DaVinci/CRD) (CRD), [CRD request generator](https://github.com/HL7-DaVinci/crd-request-generator), and [Documentation Templates and Rules](https://github.com/HL7-DaVinci/dtr) (DTR) projects.

1. Follow the `CRD` instructions to start the `ehr-server` (i.e. `gradle tomcatRun` within `{CRD}/ehr-server`)
2. Follow the `CRD` instructions to start the CDS Hooks `server` (i.e. `gradle bootRun` within `{CRD}/server`)
3. Follow the `crd-request-generator` instructions to launch the request generator (i.e. `npm start` within that project)
4. Follow the `dtr` instructions to launch the DTR application (i.e. `npm start` within that project)
5. Follow the _Getting Started_ instructions above to start the Prior Authorization `Claim/$submit` service (i.e. `./gradlew run`)
6. Using the `crd-request-generator` application (i.e. browsing `http://localhost:3000`):

- select `stu3`
- enter Age `40`
- enter Gender `Male`
- select Code `Oxygen Thing - E0424`
- select `Massachusetts` (in both Patient and Practitioner State)
- select `Include Prefetch`
- click `Submit`
